# advent-of-code-2015-rust
Attempting the Advent of Code 2015 programming challenges in Rust.

## Description

* Each day will be in its own package.
* If the challenge had a part 2 that required much additional effort or significant refactoring, there may be a separate package for that challenge. In that case there will be two for the same day, but one will be suffixed with `_2`.

## How to Run

```bash
cd day04
cargo run
```
